Please state the following when you submit: 

- Name of protein (e.g. usually a PDB identifier).
- Short description.
- Name of method used (e.g., name of force-field, QM method, basis set, etc.).
- Name of program used.
- Energy and gradient of final structure (if possible).
- Citation link (or name of authors if not published).
